'**Project New York City**'

Our first project so far outside Europe.

New York City is the heart of students in the states,

and therefore they are also in need of studenthousing.

We're hoping to begin this as soon as

the state approves.

These Urban Riggers will be placed

on the harbor side of New York City.
