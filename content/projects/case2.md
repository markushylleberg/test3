'**Project Paris**'

We're currently working on a small project in Paris.

This is the University of Paris wanting a set of containers

for their internation students.

This will hopefully launch in the spring/summer of 2020.

Speaking of France, the City of Nice is currently

doing enviromental research of placing a big amount

of Urban Rigger in their harbour.
