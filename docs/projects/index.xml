      <description>&amp;lsquo;Project Copenhagen&amp;lsquo;
We figured Copenhagen would be the best place to place our first Urban Rigger.
After having succesfully launched our first Urban Rigger 1.0,
we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten green light to place another five Urban Riggers in the spring of 2019.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Project Gothenborg&amp;lsquo;
The next big move for Urban Rigger is the project
in Gothenborg. The University of Gothenborg and
the Commune of Gothenborg, has finansed this project.
This will hopefully launch in the spring/summer of 2020.
This is so far our biggest project.
A total of 432 recycled containers
will be used for this Urban Rigger city.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Project New York City&amp;lsquo;
Our first project so far outside Europe.
New York City is the heart of students in the states,
and therefore they are also in need of studenthousing.
We&amp;rsquo;re hoping to begin this as soon as
the state approves.
These Urban Riggers will be placed
on the harbor side of New York City.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Project Paris&amp;lsquo;
We&amp;rsquo;re currently working on a small project in Paris.
This is the University of Paris wanting a set of containers
for their internation students.
This will hopefully launch in the spring/summer of 2020.
Speaking of France, the City of Nice is currently
doing enviromental research of placing a big amount
of Urban Rigger in their harbour.</description>
