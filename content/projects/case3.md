'**Project Gothenborg**'

The next big move for Urban Rigger is the project 

in Gothenborg. The University of Gothenborg and 

the Commune of Gothenborg, has finansed this project.

This will hopefully launch in the spring/summer of 2020.

This is so far our biggest project.

A total of 432 recycled containers

will be used for this Urban Rigger city.
